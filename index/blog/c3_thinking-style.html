      <h2>Your Thinking and Learning Style.</h2>
      <p class="post">
        <p>
          Additional learning style models have been developed by Gregorc (1982). In general he describes cognitive and personality dimensions that influence how individuals learn and the type of learning situation or environment they prefer. First dimension consist how people see the world - concrete or abstract; and second dimension how people order their work - sequential or random. So from here we can pick out 4 different styles of learning:<br>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Concrete sequential thinkers</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Concrete random thinkers</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Abstract sequential thinkers</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Abstract random thinkers</strong></li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
          After passing a test as a result I got that my style is <strong>“Abstract random thinker”</strong>, what means that I organize information through reflection, and thrive in unstructured, people-oriented environments. Abstract random thinkers live in a world of feelings and emotions; they like to discuss and interact with others. They learn best when they can personalize information, so cooperative learning and partner work appeal to them. <br><br>

        </p>
        <p>
          The Abstract Random Individual is characterized by:
          <ul>
            <li>Learns well through discussion and sharing of ideas</li>
            <li>Personalizes information</li>
            <li>Dislike routine procedures and orderliness</li>
            <li>Is sensitive to his/her own and others’ feelings</li>
            <li>Is usually involved in many projects or interest at one time</li>
            <li>Is focused on friends and relationship</li>
            <li>Has a fear of not being liked</li>
          </ul>
          The Abstract Random Individual tends to prefer:
          <ul>
            <li>Balance of social activities work</li>
            <li>Freedom from competition</li>
            <li>Cooperative work</li>
            <li>Assignments with room for interpretation (personalized learning that allows them to use their strengths)</li>
            <li>Ability to use their creativity – “I know what you want, but can I do it my way?”</li>
            <li>Are given personal attention and emotional support</li>
            <li>Frequent feedback – to answer the question, “Am I on the right track?”</li>
          </ul>
          The Abstract Random Individual is stretched by:
          <ul>
            <li>Working alone</li>
            <li>Time limits, such as using a stopwatch to time his/her work</li>
            <li>Attending to details and giving exact answers</li>
            <li>Concentrating on one task at a time</li>
            <li>Having to be exacting with answers</li>
            <li>Being corrected</li>
            <li>Expecting less emotional response from others
            </li>
          </ul><br>

        <p>
          I think that I agree with these characteristics. “Let me hug everything” is absolutely about me.
I love to work in a team, and discuss projects, ideas and everything else. I don’t like to learn for grade, that’s why I like DBC form of education. We learn for ourselves not for a grade that doesn’t really have value in the world. I have few years of work experience in non-formal education, and I think that personal interest and active environment make people learn more, understand what they are learning and why do they learn it, and for me team work is more efficient and more fun :) <br>
I play a lot in Dixit with my friends, and each of us has his own strategy of playing in associations. And they said about me, that I have the most unusual and sometimes not logical for others imagination. So this phrase “I know what you want, but can I do it my way?”
describes my own style of learning and doing things. I always see my own way to do something, maybe sometimes it strange and incomprehensible for other people. I can build a solution way in my head and sometimes it is hard for me to explain my thoughts, so I can do it but I can’t explain it. How Albert Einstein said “If you can’t explain it simply, you don’t understand it all enough”, so yes I am working on my this kind of problem. <br>
Also I thought about this characteristics “Has a fear of not being liked”, and I tried to analyze and compare it to me. Maybe every person needs kind and positive feedback on things that he/she is doing, but I have very good attitude to constructive and real feedback from people about my behavior and my work. <br>

          It is not everything that I wanted to say, but to summarize everything written above, I am very emotional person, and I love working with people. If you find something interesting in my personality, feel free to text me and I would be happy to work on some challenges with you guys!
