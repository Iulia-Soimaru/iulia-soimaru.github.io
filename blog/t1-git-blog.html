  <h1>What is Version Control and why do developers use it.</h1>

      <strong>Version control system</strong> - is a software that keeps tracking changes that
you’ve made on your project. Imagine that you have 10 people in your team,
working on the same project you always need to update your coworkers about
what you did, and what you changed. Version control helps you keep everything
in one place, and any person from your team can easily “pull” the latest changes
that were made to the project.
    </p>

        <strong>Why it’s a good idea to use Version Control?</strong><br>

You can make changes with confidence, and don’t be afraid that you will brake somethings, because you ALWAYS can go back to the original file. It works even for long-term. After one year you can go back to the original file and check what changes were made.
2)   File names and directory structure are located in one place for all members from your team.
3)   You can always find out who made changes to this file, and why did he or she did it reading the commit message.

        <strong>How Git tracks changes?</strong><br>

In our everyday life we create things, save them. Then we edit things and save them again. Git helps us to track everything that we are doing. Who have done changes, when and why, and what exactly was changed. Here are a few steps of saving file when you add changes:
First we should add a file to a repository, so system knows what file to track. We use command “git add .”. Dot after “add” means that you are adding all files from the directory, or you can write the name of the file.
Then we write comment what we did, and why. The easiest way to write comment is “git commit -m “your message” ”, or you can write “git commit -v” and to write large comment is opened Sublime.
Then when you are ready, you can push the file to your repository. Write “git push”, and you are done.

It is  a good habit to check your status “git status”, and you will get message where you are, and what is happening to your repository. You can do it before each step: before adding, before committing, and before pushing.

      <strong>Benefits of using GitHub.</strong><br>

GitHub is a web based repository. So if you have internet access, you can always “pull” all files from your directories. GitHub is just a place to store your source code and if you want you can share your code with other people. You don’t need to create your own server, you can use GitHub instead.<br><br>

Thank you all for attention,<br>
