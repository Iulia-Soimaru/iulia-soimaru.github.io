      <h2>Culture of DBC</h2>
      <p class="post">
        <p>
      When I first found DBC I got that this is the right place for me to be in. I have watched a lot of videos about DBC, Shereef's interviews, students videos, how the learning process is going. I belive that this kind of education is more effective than regular college. I used to work in informal education and I attended a lot of different seminars like leadership, time-management, team building, culture and other. I belive that people can learn more by doing and when they are passionate about this. What I didn't like at school and University was that we had to learn stuff that is old, nobody is using it, and it is not interesting to anybody. And now I see that DBC is a very good example of how education should be, and how people learn and build things because they want it.
    </p>
    <p>
        I live in America just 1,5 years and I feel this country is place where I want to live, but I feel very uncomfortable because I speak another language, I live in different culture, and I need to always do things that scary me. That is what we call "out of a box". DBC is one more place where I feel myself not so confident, because I am very new in technology. But, I belive that I can handle it, and I am ready for challenges that scary me :)
    </p>
    <p>
        Shereef was talking about people that expect too much from this program. Some people think they can pay 12K, join the program, sit there and listen for teachers, and then they will become good developers. But it doesn't work like that, if you don't work and just wait when teachers will give you some information, and show everything you need to know, you will fail. I think each of us should be curious first, and try to find things out of DBC curriculum. I am expecting from DBC support of what direction I need to go, and I expect from myself to work as hard as I can.
    </p>
    <p>
      What else I really like about DBC, they don't allow us to work alone. We always should pair with people from cohort. For me it is a good chance to find new friends, and watch how good am I working in a team, how can I explain things that I don't know, and listen opinion from other people, how do they learn, what do they know. And if somebody is better than me, it always stimulates me to climb up to their level.
