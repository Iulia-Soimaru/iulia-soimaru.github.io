      <h2>What is Rails?</h2>
      <p class="post">
        <p>A lot of people today are confused about what is Ruby and what is Ruby on Rails and what is Rails? Today I will try to make it more clear.
Let’s start first with understanding what is programming language and what is a framework. <br><br>

A <strong>programming language</strong> is a formal constructed language designed to communicate instructions to a machine, particularly a computer. Programming languages can be used to create programs to control the behavior of a machine or to express algorithms. The most popular languages today are: <strong>C, Java, PHP, JavaScript, C++, Python, Ruby, Shell, C# and so on.</strong> <br><br>
<strong>What does Software Framework mean? </strong>
A software framework is a concrete or conceptual platform where common code with generic functionality can be selectively specialized or overridden by developers or users. Frameworks take the form of libraries, where a well-defined application program interface (API) is reusable anywhere within the software under development. From my perspective, a framework does several things: <br><br>

- it makes it easier to work with complex technologies <br>
- it ties together a bunch of discrete objects/components into something more useful <br>
- it forces the team (or just me) to implement code in a way that promotes consistent coding, fewer bugs, and more flexible applications <br>
- everyone can easily test and debug the code, even code that they didn't write. <br><br>
I will give you few examples of popular frameworks: <br><br>
For <strong>Ruby</strong> - Ruby on Rails, Lotus, Sinatra <br>
For <strong>JavaScript</strong> - AngularJS, Backbone.js, Ember.js <br>
For <strong>Python</strong> - Flask, Django <br>
For <strong>PHP</strong> - Laravel, Symfony, Phalcon. <br><br>
I think you can guess now what is Ruby and what is Rails :) </p>
        <p><strong>WHAT IS RUBY??</strong> <br><br>
          Ruby is a powerful, dynamic and general purpose Object Oriented Programming language. Ruby was conceived in Japan in 1995 by a Japanese Programmer named Yukihiro Matsumoto. He is also called "Matz" by Ruby developers all over the world. <br>

Ruby is not a compiled language like C++, Java, C# etc. Matz decided to create Ruby because he wanted to create a language that balanced functional programming with imperative programming. Matz was looking to create a language which is elegant like Perl , Object Oriented like Python and has some built in features like Smalltalk. Other than these languages it is also inspired by Eiffel, Ada, and Lisp . Also it has been said by community members that it was named "Ruby" as it come out in June and Ruby is the birthstone of June whereas Perl is the birthstone of July and "Perl" came out in July. <br>

Ruby is Open Source (means anybody can download it and use it).</p>
      <p><strong>WHAT IS RAILS??</strong> <br><br>
        Ruby on Rails often shortened as Rails or ROR is an open source web application development framework written in the Ruby language. It is designed to make programming web applications easier by making assumptions about what every developer needs to get started. It allows you to write less code while accomplishing more than many other languages and frameworks. Experienced Rails developers also report that it makes web application development more fun.. Ruby on Rails was extracted by David Heinemeier Hansson. Hansson first released Ruby on Rails as open source in July 2004, but did not share commit rights to the project until February 2005. Ruby on Rails uses the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture to organize the web application programming. <br>

The Rails philosophy includes two major guiding principles: <br><br>

- Don’t Repeat Yourself: DRY is a principle of software development which states that "Every piece of knowledge must have a single, unambiguous, authoritative representation within a system." By not writing the same information over and over again, our code is more maintainable, more extensible, and less buggy. <br>
- Convention Over Configuration: Rails has opinions about the best way to do many things in a web application, and defaults to this set of conventions, rather than require that you specify every minutiae through endless configuration files.</p>
